## 🖼️ Image Segmentation and Processing with scikit-image

In this project, we’ll dive into the world of **image processing** using the **scikit-image** library. We’ll explore **image segmentation** techniques and methods for **noise removal** in images. By the end, we’ll apply these skills to detect objects like **license plates** from vehicle images. Ready to explore image processing? Let’s get started! 🚀📷

## Project Overview

**Image processing** involves applying various operations to images to extract meaningful information or transform them for a specific purpose. In this project, we’ll work with **scikit-image**, a Python library that provides numerous image processing algorithms. We’ll focus on **image segmentation**, a technique used to separate objects within an image, and we’ll experiment with **noise removal** filters to clean up images.

By using these methods, we’ll detect objects like **license plates** in images and visualize the results using **Matplotlib**. This project covers the essential building blocks of image processing with Python, showcasing the power of scikit-image for segmentation and filtering tasks.
